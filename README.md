### Collaboration and Work Distribution
Both team members equally shared the workload, tackling both coding and design aspects of the project. We worked together on a single device for coding to immediately share feedback and make decisions quickly. This setup helped us make sure everything was done right the first time, whether we were sitting side by side or virtually. For the design and schematics, we each took on parts that matched our strengths but always came together to review each other's work. This teamwork ensured our project was well-coordinated and met all our goals.
